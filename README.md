Project 4:

This project simulates the scheduling component of an operating system, where oss manages multiple child processes, using message queues for communication, shared memory for a system clock, and a control table to track process states and priorities. So far, the code includes process scheduling, basic process management, inter-process communication, signal handling, and logging. Remaining tasks involve refining the scheduling logic, implementing additional process states, and adding detailed performance reporting to complete the project requirements.

How to run project:

1. Go into terminal
2. Run command: make
3. Run command: ./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 100000 -f test_log.txt
